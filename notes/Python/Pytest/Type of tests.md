- **Unit test:** A test that checks a small bit of code, like a function or a class, in isolation of the
rest of the system. Unit tests run against the Tasks data structure.

- **Integration test:** A test that checks a larger bit of the code, maybe several classes, or a
subsystem. Mostly it’s a label used for some test larger than a unit test, but smaller than a
system test.

- **System test (end-to-end):** A test that checks all of the system under test in an environment
as close to the end-user environment as possible.

- **Functional test:** A test that checks a single bit of functionality of a system. A test that
checks how well we add or delete or update a task item in Tasks is a functional test.

- **Subcutaneous test:** A test that doesn’t run against the final end-user interface, but against
an interface just below the surface.

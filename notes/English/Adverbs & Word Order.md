## 📌 **1. What are adverbs?**

Adverbs describe:
- **how** (quickly, slowly)
- **when** (yesterday, soon)
- **where** (here, outside)
- **how often** (always, usually, sometimes)
- **degree** (very, quite, almost)
# 📍 2. **General Rule of Word Order**

### **Subject + Verb + Object + Adverb**

**I read the book carefully.**

# 📍 3. **Adverbs of Manner (how?)**

➡️ usually go **after the verb** or **after the object**
**She sings beautifully.**  
**He completed the task quickly.**
⚠️ In passive voice → after the main verb  
**The message was delivered successfully.**

# 📍 4. **Adverbs of Frequency (how often?)**

(always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely, never)
### ✔️ Position: **before the main verb**
**I always wake up early.**  
**He usually eats breakfast.**
### ✔️ With _be_ → **after “be”**
**She is always late.**
### ✔️ With auxiliary verbs → **after auxiliary**
**You can never know.**

# 📍 5. **Adverbs of Time (when?)**

(today, now, in the morning, recently)

➡️ usually at the **end of the sentence**

**We met yesterday.**  
**I will call you later.**

Can also be at the start for emphasis:  
**Today, I feel better.**

# 📍 6. **Adverbs of Place (where?)**

➡️ placed **after the verb** or **at the end**

**He is waiting outside.**  
**She looked everywhere.**

# 📍 7. **Adverbs of Degree (how much?)**

(very, quite, almost, too, enough)

➡️ usually **before adjectives** or **before other adverbs**

**The test was very difficult.**  
**She speaks quite slowly.**

⚠️ “enough” goes **after** the word it modifies:  
**He isn’t tall enough.**

# 📍 8. **Adverbs with Auxiliary Verbs**

Order: **Subject + auxiliary + adverb + main verb**

**She has already finished.**  
**They will probably agree.**

# 📍 9. **Mid-position Adverbs**

Many adverbs go in the **middle of the sentence**, typically:
- after the subject, before the main verb
- after first auxiliary
- after "be" verb

Examples:  
**He usually works late.**  
**They have just arrived.**  
**She is never angry.**

# 📍 10. **Sentence Adverbs (comment adverbs)**

(honestly, unfortunately, obviously, surprisingly)

➡️ express opinion about the whole sentence  
➡️ usually at the **beginning**

**Honestly, I don’t know.**  
**Unfortunately, we lost the game.**

Can also appear before the main verb:  
**We obviously need more time.**

# 📍 11. **Multiple Adverbs (order rule)**

When using **more than one adverb**, the usual order:
**Manner → Place → Time**
Example:  
**She worked hard (manner) at the office (place) yesterday (time).**

# 📍 12. **Common Mistakes**

### ❌ _He speaks English good._
✔️ **He speaks English well.**
### ❌ _I meet him often at work._ (correct, but not natural)
✔️ **I often meet him at work.**  
✔️ **I meet him at work often.**
### ❌ _I very like it._
✔️ **I really like it.** (degree adverb)

# 🧠 Summary (for quick review)
- Frequency → **before main verb**, after **be**
- Manner → **end of sentence**
- Time → **end** (or beginning)
- Place → **end**
- Degree → **before adj/adv**
- Comment adverbs → **start**
- Order of multiple adverbs → **manner → place → time**

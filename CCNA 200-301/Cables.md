**RJ - 45** - ports (RJ - Registered Jack)
RJ -45 connectors is used on the end of copper Ethernet cable. 

**Ethernet** - is a collocation of network protocols/standards. 
**Bits** - 0 or 1
**Bytes**  - 8 bits

**Speed** is measured in **bits per second** (Kbps, Mbps, Gbps, etc),  not bytes per second. 
- 1 kilobit (Kb) = 1 000 bits
- 1 megabit (Mb) = 1 000 000 bits 
- 1 gigabit (Gb) = 1 000 000 000 bits
- 1 terabit (Tb) = 1 000 000 000 000 bits

**Ethernet Standards**
- Defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard in 1983
- IEEE = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
- BASE T = refers to baseband signaling 
  T = twisted pair cabling 
  
**UTP Cables** - Unshieded Twisted Pair (8 wires)

**10BASE-T**
**100BASE-T** 
- use 2 pairs (4 wires)

**1000BASE-T**
**10GBASE-T**
- use 2 pairs (8 wires)
  
**Transmit (Tx)**
**Receive (Rx)**

The network interface card on PC or server **transmits** data on points 1 and 2, the interface on switch **receive** data on on points 1 and 2. 

Routers transmits data on pins 1 and 2, and receive data on pins 3 and 6. Switches are opposite they receive data on 1 and 2 and   transmits data  3 and 6. 

10GBASE-SR maximum cable length - 400 meters 

**Crossover cable** 

**Auto MDI - X** - allows to auto detect witch pin transmitted data and witch pins are receive.  

**1000BASE-T** / **10GBASE-T** cables  each pair is bidirectional. 
**SFP Transceiver** (Small Form-Factor Pluggable)

**Fiber - Optic cables**
- single mode 
- multimode

A **full-duplex** connection allows both devices to send and receive data at the same time.
**Multimode Fiber cables** have a wider fiberglass core than single-mode fiber cables.

Questions and Answers
Why are the wire pairs in a UTP cable twisted together?
 - *It protects against EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)*
 
If Auto MDI-X is disabled, what kind of UTP cable should be used to connect a PC and a switch?
- *straight-through cable*
